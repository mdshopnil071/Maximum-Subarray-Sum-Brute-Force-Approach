# Maximum-Subarray-Sum-Brute-Force-Approach
Today I learn this java programme and I would love to gladly share the code. This Java program implements a brute force solution to find the maximum sum of all possible contiguous subarrays in a given array. The program uses three nested loops to generate all possible subarrays and calculates their sums.

Algorithm Description:
The algorithm works by:
Using the first loop to select the starting position of each subarray
Using the second loop to select the ending position of each subarray
Using the third loop to calculate the sum of elements in the current subarray
Keeping track of the maximum sum encountered

Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(nÂ³) - due to three nested loops
Space Complexity: O(1) - only using constant extra space

Use Cases
This implementation is suitable for:
Educational purposes to understand the brute force approach
Small datasets where performance is not critical
Understanding the maximum subarray problem fundamentals
